# Kanji Practice

An app for practicing and memorizing kanji. For use with some other drawing platform, like a piece of paper or a whiteboard.

This is a personal project, so it is made for my personal needs, but everyone is free to use it or modify it!

## Features

* Add new kanjis and their pronounciation to the app
* You can also delete old kanjis that you don't want to practice anymore
* Select a subset of them, the "practice set", to practice at a time
* Enter the practice screen and it will display the pronounciation of the kanjis you selected, one by one
* Once you have written down the kanji, check if it is correct by pressing on the pronounciation
